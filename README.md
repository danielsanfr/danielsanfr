## Hi there 👋

I’m **Daniel San**, Computer Engineer (Graduated by [Federal University of Alagoas](http://www.ufal.edu.br/)) currently working at Lapaza Empreendimentos LTDA as Tech Leader, working in the field since 2012. Born in 1992, married, living in Alagoas (Brazil 🇧🇷).

Learning new things is always very exciting. Open Source is incredible. And nothing better to spend time than watching a good movie or TV series. What is making me more excited now is to be studying about embedded systems and IoT.

- 💻 I’m currently working on [Vago](https://www.vagoonline.com.br)
- 💡 I’m currently learning [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html)
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on **Kotlin Multiplatform**, **Qt** or **IoT** projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **English speaking** and **Kotlin Multiplatform**
- 💬 Ask me about **Android**
