## Hi there 👋

I’m **Daniel San**, Computer Engineer (Graduated by [Federal University of Alagoas](https://www.ufal.edu.br/)) currently working at CI&T as Software Architect, working in the field since 2012. Born in 1992, living in Alagoas (Brazil 🇧🇷).

Learning new things is always very exciting. Open Source is incredible. It's great to spend time watching a good anime, movie or TV series, or playing video games on PC. What is making me more excited now is to be studying about embedded systems and IoT.

- 💻 I’m currently working on [CI&T](https://ciandt.com/)
- 💡 I’m currently learning [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html) and [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on **Kotlin Multiplatform**, **Jetpack Compose**, **Qt** or **IoT** projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **English speaking**, **Kotlin Multiplatform** and **Jetpack Compose**
- 💬 Ask me about **Android**
- 📫 How to reach me: [My personal website](https://danielsan.com.br), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/danielsanfr) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DanielSanFR)
